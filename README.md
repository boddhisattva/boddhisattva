## How I intend to be of service as a Ruby on Rails consultant:

- From building **MVPs** to working on **large-scale Ruby on Rails apps**, as a software engineer:
  - I have experience with
    -   Using **[Packs-Rails](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails)**, **Sorbet**, Rails engines, **Elasticsearch**, RabbitMQ, **Redis** etc.,
    -   **Improving performance and observability** of Rails apps(using Datadog, Redash, New Relic etc.,)
    -   Debugging, maintaining, refactoring & enhancing Rails apps
    -   **Leading projects**

  - I **care about**(in addition to what's previously mentioned above)
    - **Being product minded**
    - Collaborating with different stakeholders(including members of other teams & end users) to better serve everyone

- Many people have told me **communication** is one of my **strengths** & I’d be happy to put that to good use

- There is a saying failure can teach you a lot more than success. Having **worked** in **International teams(based in Singapore, UK and currently Germany) for 7+ years** has **taught me**(some the hard way) a lot about **what key ingredients make great teams**. I’d be happy to leverage this experience if & when needed

- **I enjoy sharing my two cents when needed through pairing, coaching**(to enable others to think for themselves & eventually be more independent), **mentoring**(I have been doing probono coaching & mentorship [here](https://bit.ly/probono_coaching_mentoring_connect_with_mohnish) for a while now), or even just being a sounding board

**Having other ideas in mind on how you'd like to collaborate?**: 
 - I also value [serving as a teams coach](https://www.mohnishjadwani.com/being_of_service_as_a_team_coach/)
