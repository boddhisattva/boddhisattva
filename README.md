## How I intend to be of service as a Ruby on Rails consultant:

- From building **MVPs** to working on **large-scale Ruby on Rails apps**, as a software engineer:
  - I have experience with
    -   Using **[Packs-Rails](https://github.com/rubyatscale/packs-rails)**, **Sorbet**, Rails engines, **Elasticsearch**, RabbitMQ, **Redis** etc.,
    -   **Improving performance and observability** of Rails apps(using Datadog, Redash, New Relic etc.,)
    -   Debugging, maintaining, refactoring & enhancing Rails apps
    -   **Leading projects**

  - I **care about**(in addition to what's previously mentioned above)
    - **Being product minded**
    - Collaborating with different stakeholders(including members of other teams & end users) to better serve everyone

- Many people have told me **communication** is one of my **strengths** & I’d be happy to put that to good use

- There is a saying failure can teach you a lot more than success. Having **worked** in **International teams(based in Singapore, UK and currently Germany) for almost 7 years** has **taught me**(some the hard way) a lot about **what key ingredients make great teams**. I’d be happy to leverage this experience if & when needed

- **I enjoy sharing my two cents when needed through pairing, coaching**(to enable others to think for themselves & eventually be more independent), **mentoring**(I have been doing probono coaching & mentorship [here](https://bit.ly/probono_coaching_mentoring_connect_with_mohnish) for a while now), or even just being a sounding board

## Having other ideas in mind on how you'd like to collaborate?
 - I also value [serving as a teams coach](https://www.mohnishjadwani.com/being_of_service_as_a_team_coach/)
 - I look forward to discussing other collaboration opportunities together :). You can find my contact details below.

## Last but not the least

If you are or you know someone who is looking for a **human-centered programmer** with some or all of the above mentioned experience/skills and if you think I could be a good fit for such opportunities, I'd sincerely appreciate your reaching out to me(via the contact details above) or spreading the word, thank you :) 

**P.S**: 

1. **I'm open to discuss contract to full time hire roles too**, however there's a current need(happy to discuss the reasons transparently over a call) for me to start work as a contractor/freelancer.

2. I have intentionally removed my contact number from my public résumé above. Happy to share it via email if needed.

3. I'm happy to share additional references as needed. If you'd like to speak to an ex colleague of mine about my work, I can also arrange the same as needed.
