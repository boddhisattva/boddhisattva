## Joyful Greetings for the day ‚òÄÔ∏è üå± üôÇ 

**Work experience**: Programmer(12+ yrs, [R√©sum√©](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10kOVqAxCgsI7_kNAtUW4aXIuuzs1DqFL/view?usp=sharing)) | **Rails(10+ yrs, [Code sample](https://github.com/boddhisattva/mars_rover/))** |  Independent Software consultant(3+ yrs)

**About**: Mohnish **cares about people & his work**. As a **fellow human**, **empathy** is a core value amongst [other human & engineering values](https://bit.ly/mohnish_human_and_engineering_values) .

**Location**: I'm based in Berlin, Germany (it currently corresponds to CEST timezone)

**Other Timezones I can work in**:  I can sustainably overlap 4-5 hrs with Eastern/Pacific time or similarly with other timezones

**How I intend to be of service** as a (Freelance) Senior/Staff Backend engineer/consultant:

- From building **MVPs** to working on **large-scale Ruby on Rails apps**, as a software engineer:
  - I have experience with 
    -   Using **Packwerk**, **Sorbet**, Rails engines, **Elasticsearch**, RabbitMQ, **Redis** etc.,
    -   **Improving performance and observability** of Rails apps(using Datadog, Redash, New Relic etc.,) 
    -   Debugging, maintaining, refactoring & enhancing Rails apps
    -   **Leading projects**

  - I care about(in addition to what's previously mentioned above)
    - Being product minded
    - Collaborating with different stakeholders(including end users) to better serve everyone
  
- Many people have told me **communication** is one of my **strengths** & I‚Äôd be happy to put that to good use

- There is a saying failure can teach you a lot more than success. Having **worked** in **International teams for almost 7 years** has **taught me**(some the hard way) a lot about **what key ingredients make great teams**. I‚Äôd be happy to leverage this experience if & when needed.

- **Sharing my two cents when needed through pairing, coaching**(to enable others to think for themselves & eventually be more independent), **mentoring**(I have been doing probono coaching & mentorship [here](https://bit.ly/coaching_mentoring_connect_with_mohnish) for a while now), or even just being a sounding board.

- Having other ideas in mind? I look forward to discussing other collaboration opportunities together :)

If you are or you know someone who is looking for a **human-centered programmer** with some or all of the above mentioned experience/skills and if you think I could be a good fit for such opportunities, I'd sincerely appreciate your reaching out to me(via: **mail4mohnishj@gmail.com**) or spreading the word, thank you :)
